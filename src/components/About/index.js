    <p className="text_footer">When you like old movies (Night of the Living Dead, Freaks, Maudlin, Chaplin etc...) you can find these movies easily on the right and left. Why can we find them easily ? Because they are free of rights, you don't need a license to use them like Netflix, Canal+ or others do, and they are not subject to copyright. These royalty-free movies are found on free streaming platforms like Youtube for example because they are now in the public domain.</p>
    
    <p className="text_footer">Today there is no platform gathering all the best royalty free movies. It is not easy to find them, because they are all scattered between different archive platforms according to their country of origin. The site <a className="link_footer" href="http://archive.org/"> archive.org</a> centralizes all cultural support not being subjected to copyright anymore. It is a huge database gathering films, music, images, books. Finding your way around is not easy.</p> 
    
    <p className="text_footer">Oldix aims to select the most popular films and make them easily accessible. Every year new films are released into the public domain, and the site will also grow over time. The site is and will remain free of charge to reach as many people as possible.</p>
