    <p className="text_footer text_footer_italic">In the United States, a film/show is protected by copyright for 95 years from the date of its first public broadcast on American territory. This 95-year term applies to films/shows produced and directed by a company (the "work made for hire", comparable to the "collective work" in French law.
    This "American" term of 95 years applies only in the United States. In France, the American film will be protected for the "French" duration (for the authors: 70 years after the death of the last of them; for the producers and performers, 50 years after the first American broadcast).
    In fact, the American term applies in France only if it is shorter than the French term." (pp.406-407)."</p>
